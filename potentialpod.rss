      Potential is a careers podcast with a difference. In each episode, physics 
      graduates share their stories about the good times, the hard times, the ups and the 
      downs of starting a career. It’s a podcast about falling over, and then picking 
      yourself back up again. It’s about finding your path, and then changing direction 
      completely. If you're in the middle of your physics degree and wondering, 
      "What do I do next?" ... we're here to help.

      <title>You're An Imposter</title>
      <description>
       How on earth did I get into this degree? Why did anyone hire me for this job? 
       I'm a total fraud — and one day they're going to realise, and throw me out. 
       Sound familiar? You're not alone: pretty much everyone experiences Impostor 
       Syndrome at some point. We've assembled a bunch of physics graduates who've been 
       there, faced the self-doubt, and come through the other side. They're here to 
       share their wisdom and tips for talking back to the voices of doubt. If they can 
       do it, so can you.

      <title>The Benefit Of Hindsight</title>
      <description>
       In this final episode of this season of Potential we ask our physics graduates, 
       if they could sit down with their younger selves back in first or second year of 
       university, what advice would they give? What have they learned since they 
       graduated that might help? We collected all that advice into five buckets of 
       wisdom — and who knows, maybe some of it will resonate with you too.
